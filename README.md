# SentinelLogs
The Intelligent Log Monitoring & Anomaly Detection System is a Python-based platform designed to help teams monitor application
logs in real time, detect abnormal behavior, and receive alerts before incidents impact users .

---

## Modern applications generate thousands of logs per day:

- Errors are hidden inside log noise
- Manual log inspection is slow and unreliable
- Alerts are often triggered only after outages
  
## Without intelligent monitoring, teams:
- React instead of preventing incidents
- Lose time debugging production issues
- Lack visibility into application behavior
